In the Dependant library 'TFT_eSPI', the following files have been modified to work in this hybrid enviroment:
1. User_Setup_Select.h
2. TFT_eSPI.h
3. TFT_eSPI.cpp
4. TFT_config. h
5. processors/TFT_eSPI32.h, ine 138, modified line to read "#include "SPIFFSJMH.h".
You can use MELD to see the differences. 
But probably easier to just copy these files from an already working project, with the same enviroment as this project
in the user_setup_select.h file, select the appropriate configuration for the display you're using. For SPI displays:
        #include <User_Setups/Setup42_ILI9341_ESP32.h>           // Setup file for ESP32 and SPI ILI9341 240x320
or
        #include <User_Setups/Setup21_ILI9488.h>           // Setup file for ESP32 and ILI9488 SPI bus TFT        
On TFTMsgBox.h, commnent or uncomment the "#define HiRes" (found @~ line 17) to match the resolution of the display being used.
